/**
 * Proc called when you want the atom to spin around the center of its icon (or where it would be if its transform var is translated)
 * By default, it makes the atom spin forever and ever at a speed of 60 rpm.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * speed: how much it takes for the atom to complete one 360° rotation
 * * loops: how many times do we want the atom to rotate
 * * clockwise: whether the atom ought to spin clockwise or counter-clockwise
 * * segments: in how many animate calls the rotation is split. Probably unnecessary, but you shouldn't set it lower than 3 anyway.
 * * parallel: whether the animation calls have the ANIMATION_PARALLEL flag, necessary for it to run alongside concurrent animations.
 * * tag: animation tag to use, for parralel animations only
