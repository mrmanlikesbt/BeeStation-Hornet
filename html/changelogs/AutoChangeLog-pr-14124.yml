changes:
  - bugfix: cryocells/medbots will no longer attempt to endlessly heal carbons with
      robotic limbs
  - refactor: fixed many instances of updatehealth() either being called needlessly
      or not at all within on_mob_life() and in various other parts of the code
  - refactor: damage procs now return useful information--the actual net change in
      damage on the mob. added a unit test for this
  - bugfix: Regenerating mobs no longer stop regenerating no matter hit with what.
  - bugfix: Pressure damage is now properly modified by a mob's brute damage modifier.
  - bugfix: Fixes some occasions which some effects (explodable worn items) won't
      respond to hits.
  - refactor: Refactored core code related to mobs sustaining damage.
  - bugfix: Fixes holy water exiting your system at double the rate on metabolism
  - bugfix: Holy Water no longer spams cultists with big text every time, it's much
      more tame now
  - refactor: Refactored zombies to use the regenerator component. Now they'll have
      a slight glow/animation when the regeneration actually kicks in.
