changes:
  - bugfix: fixes blindness persisting past removal and re-insertion of eyes
  - refactor: Drowsiness and Blurred Eyes are now tracked via status effect.
  - refactor: Drugginess is now a status effect. Now any living mob can be high and
      speak beach-bum instead of just carbons and humanoids. Drug effects should also
      be more consistently removed on aheal / in rare cases.
  - admin: Admin basic disease trigger and custom disease renaming should now work
      properly.
