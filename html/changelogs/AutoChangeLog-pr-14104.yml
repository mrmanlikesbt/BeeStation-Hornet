changes:
  - rscadd: adds suicide act for carp plushies
  - rscadd: GAGs carp and snake plushies. They now can be in different colors.
  - tweak: dehydrated carps can transform when exposed to any reagent
  - tweak: dehydrated carps have a 25% chance to spawn a cayenne plushy, which will
      spawn cayenne when rehydrated.
  - tweak: Cayenne will spawn as the rare Albino/Silver carp, rather than randomized
      colors
  - balance: Cayenne has been buffed to have health just slightly above half of what
      spacedragon carps have, and a movespeed similiar to humans.
