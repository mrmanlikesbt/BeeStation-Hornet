changes:
  - code_imp: Subtypes of [/obj/item/storage] no longer delete their base storage
      datum, instead, the base storage datum isn't made in the first place. This saves
      ~0.1 seconds of init time
  - code_imp: Material storage boxes now make use of the amount argument when initializing
      stacks. This saves ~0.1 seconds of init time when they are present
  - bugfix: Fixed item stacks sometimes having a zero amount
